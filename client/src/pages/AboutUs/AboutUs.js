          <p>{`It began with a fellowship in the 80's with one Indonesian university student, Jimmy Oentoro, in the West Coast of USA that eventually gave birth to the IFGF church. In 1987, Jimmy Oentoro was ordained by Rev. Dick Iverson at Bible Temple Church and the IFGF fellowship became the “IFGF Church” with churches in San Francisco, Fresno, Oklahoma, and Los Angeles. The movement spread into more cities in USA and IFGF church in Houston was one of the fruits of this movement in the 1990s.`}</p>
          <br />
          <p>{`In 1990, IFGF movement declared its mission; “People is Our Mission.” Then, during IFGF World Conference in 2003, IFGF proclaimed the theme “United to Bless the Nations” as its vision as we're called to bless the nations. In accordance with this vision, the name Indonesian Full Gospel Fellowship was changed to International Full Gospel Fellowship. Subsequently, in 2013, IFGF revisited IFGF main mission “People is Our Mission” and clarified it by adding a tagline “Connect with God, Make Disciples” because we believe that this is the heart of God for IFGF, which is bringing people to connect them with God and to disciple others. Currently, IFGF has over 3400 churches in 46 nations.`}</p>
          <br />
          <p>{`The IFGF Houston church started with a calling to a simple man who answered the call of God, Pastor Somi Pranoto. Pastor Somi Pranoto and family left Fresno (where his friends are) and moved to Houston. It was a hard good-bye but also marked a new excitement for the work of God in city of Houston and state of Texas. IFGF Houston started as a house church with only twelve people in attendance at Brother David Trisna's residence in Friendswood, Texas. The fellowship started as a Bible Study, which was the foundation of the church, and was supported by Pastor Paulus Kristanto and other IFGF pastors and leaders from Fresno, Los Angeles, Oklahoma, and local leaders such as David Trisna and Simon and Mary Kaonang.`}</p>
          <br />
          <p>{`A Revival Crusade run by Pastor Jimmy Oentoro on June 26th 1993 inaugurated the church. The official Sunday Service began in June at Evangel Assembly of God. The church grew and was blessed. In November 1994, the church planted an IFGF church in Austin and then in the summer of 1995, it planted another IFGF church in Dallas. In 1995, Pastor Somi Pranoto was ordained by Rev. Dick Iverson, Pastor Jimmy Oentoro and Pastor Paul Tan in IFGF Los Angeles. Subsequently, in 2001, IFGF Houston Church was blessed with a piece of land located in the Bellaire and Wilcrest area. The church building was finally dedicated and opened for use starting in February 2005.`}</p>
          <br />
          <p>{`The church continued to grow and bless the surrounding community with many events and missions including church planting in 3 cities in Ecuador (Quito, Ambato and Lago Agrio). In 2014, the church growth prompted us to build a second building, a multi-functional venue, to meet the needs of our congregations as well as the community.`}</p>
